            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have recently moved from the UK to South Africa and am seeking a new role. For the last 5 years I
                have been working for Celestra as a Point of Sales Configuration Technician. </p>
            <p>I am currently near the end of an online course with HyperionDev to receive a Certificate of
                Software Engineering. Which has helped me greatly to improve my skills and learn useful skills
                such as Python and Django for website design.</p>
            <p>I am a responsible person who can function effectively in a team setting whilst completing a wide
                variety of individual responsibilities as required. I am a passionate, motivated and reliable
                person, with a drive for excellence and an enquiring, analytical mind.</p>

                <div class="job-header">
                    <h3>POS Configuration Technician</h3>
                    <span class="company">Celestra Ltd.</span>
                    <span class="date">April 2019 - Nov 2024</span>
                </div>
                <ul class="job-duties">
                    <p>Work individually or in teams separated by different Clients to either build or
                        configure customer hardware or software depending on their specific requirements.
                        The Hardware that was worked on includes Tills, Chip & PIN devices, Tablets, Digital
                        Menu Boards, Media screens, Kitchen Management Systems, Wi-Fi and other industry
                        related IT equipment. </p>
                    <p>Some clients that I worked on for Celestra include McDonalds, Costa, Whitbread,
                        Stonegate, Marstons, KFC, Starbucks and Premier Inn.</p>
                    <p>My responsibilities included the assembly and configuration of hardware for specific
                        clients and then for some the configuration of the software. Some clients required
                        the OSâ€™s which were usually Windows to be installed on the devices before
                        configuration. Some devices had Operating Systems pre-installed and were only
                        required to be configured for the specific site.</p>
                    <p>I also worked in the Support Centre where stock that was returned from site was
                        evaluated to make sure it was still operational and not damaged. If the hardware
                        was damaged the role was to record the fault and then request a replacement which
                        would be received later in the Support Centre to be configured for site. And if
                        undamaged the hardware would be reset and configured from scratch.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, I have used my IT and analytical skills to solve any IT related
                        issues that have arisen, such as issues with the mail servers. I also took
                        ownership of the migration of data to a new computer system, which I completed
